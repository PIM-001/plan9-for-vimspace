                            PLAN 9 FOR VIMSPACE      

plan9-for-vimspace provides plan9 inspired utilities for vim. Currently, it
only provides acme emulation and support for acme addresses in |:edit| and
related commands, but a plumbing system and support for the editing language in
sam are planned.

- CONFIGURATION                               *plan9-for-vimspace-configuration*

					  	       *g:plan9#modules#enabled*

The plugin is composed of modules. What modules are enabled depends on the
value of `g:plan9#modules#enabled`. By default, "acme" and "address_handler"
modules are enabled.

On initialization, each module configures itself (unused configuration
variables are simply not created). The following is a list of available
configuration variables for each module:

1) ACME

- *g:plan9#acme#map_mouse*
  Default = 1

  Remap the mouse buttons as in the acme editor:
	- <MiddleMouse> executes the selection.
	- <RightMouse> moves to the location defined by the address under
	   the cursor, or searches for the word under the cursor.

- *g:plan9#acme#move_mouse*
  Default = 0

  Attempt to move the mouse on actions. (Not yet implemented)

- *g:plan9#acme#map_keyboard*
  Default = 1

  Provide keyboard mappings for the acme mouse actions.
